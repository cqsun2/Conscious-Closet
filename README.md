# Conscious Closet

Conscious Closet is a consumer-focused shopping tool designed to steer you clear of fast fashion. We believe that looking good shouldn't come at the expense of the planet. That's why we've created a platform that combines the convenience of online shopping with a commitment to sustainability.

At Conscious Closet, our mission is to challenge the status quo of the fashion industry by advocating for sustainable and ethical practices. We believe in promoting conscious consumption, empowering individuals to make informed choices that prioritize environmental responsibility, social justice, and the well-being of future generations.
